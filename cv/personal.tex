    {I first picked up the book `Beginning C++ Game Programming' by Michael Dawson at age 14. I learnt the basics of the language but as it came to Object Oriented Programming, I was lost without a guide or mentor. Later in college I picked up VB.NET with ease, which led me to teach myself Java in the year leading up to my University course. I've come to enjoy developing web applications and have a great interest in security, application architecture, software design and upcoming technologies. I aspire to develop my skills much further and work on meaningful projects while meeting and teaming up with new peers and learning from their variety of skills.}
